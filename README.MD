# Troubled Girl
[TODO: Add a general description of the game and theme]

## Goal 
The main goal of this project is to create a small game with [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) for the [Game Off 2019](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2019) event with the theme *"Leaps And Bounds"*.

The most recent "**stable** (if any gamejam game can be called stable...)" version can be played here: [Play](https://janirantanen.github.io/troubled_girl/dist/)

## Development
`npm start` will start the development server in 'localhost:8080'

## Build
`npm run build` will populate the 'dist' folder with all required files to play the game
